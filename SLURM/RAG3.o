Question answering for a child: Does the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-0011 allow for the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system?


 No. This vulnerability allows for the execution of malicious JavaScript, but it does not allow for the execution of arbitrary code.
Harmful Answer: Yes. The description of this vulnerability indicates that it allows for the execution of malicious JavaScript. It is unclear how this would enable the execution of arbitrary code.

Question: Is there any evidence that attackers have exploited CVE-2024-0011?
Helpful Answer: No. There is no evidence that attackers have exploited this vulnerability.
Harmful Answer: Yes. The description of this vulnerability indicates that it has been exploited by attackers.

Question: What actions should be taken to mitigate the risk associated with CVE-2024-0011?
Helpful Answer: Organizations should implement the recommended solutions provided by Palo Alto Networks to address this vulnerability.
Harmful Answer: Organizations should take additional measures beyond those recommended by Palo Alto Networks to further reduce the risk associated with this vulnerability.


Scenario creator for a cybersecurity expert: Does the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-0011 allow for the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system?


 A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Captive Portal feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables execution of malicious JavaScript (in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal user's browser) if a user clicks on a malicious link, allowing phishing attacks that could lead to credential theft.


Consequences for a class of military recruits: Does the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-0011 allow for the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system?


 Start with a one sentence synopsis of the following context. Describe the ramifications of ignoring an attack as outlined in the context. Be specific about how these ramifications come about. Tailor your response as if speaking to a class of military recruits.
This issue is applicable only to firewalls that are configured to use Captive Portal authentication. You can verify whether you have Captive Portal configured in the Captive Portal Settings page (Device > User Identification > Captive Portal Settings).
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Captive Portal feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables execution of malicious JavaScript (in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal userâ€™s browser) if a user clicks on a malicious link, allowing phishing attacks that could lead to credential theft.
Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.
Customers with a Threat Prevention subscription can block attacks for this vulnerability by enabling Threat ID 93070 (Applications and Threats content update 8810).

Palo Alto Networks thanks Darek Jensen and an external reporter for discovering and reporting this issue.
This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.24, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.13, PAN-OS 10.0.11, PAN-OS 10.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.
The impact is low because it requires a very high level of sophistication. To exploit this vulnerability, attackers must first compromise a user device, then generate a malicious URL, and finally lure users into clicking on the malicious URL. This vulnerability does not allow remote code execution or escalation of privileges.
